###"Cool Neighborhoods NYC" 
It is an innovative, citywide effort initiated by New York City to tackle extreme heat, which contributes to more deaths annually than all other natural disasters combined. The investment budget for the programme is $106 million.

The Cool Neighborhoods NYC project identifies heat vulnerability through the development and use of the Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI), a composite index that combines a variety of physical and social indicators that affect a community's heat vulnerability.

# Case Study

## Economic and Social Benefits

The initiative is expected to yield significant economic and social benefits, including:

* Reduced **energy consumption and costs** due to increased canopy cover and cool roofs, leading to an annual **$1 million** in energy cost savings.

* Enhanced public health outcomes through targeted interventions and educational programs, aiming to decrease **heat-related illnesses and mortality**.

* Improved **environmental quality and biodiversity** through increased green space and urban tree canopies.

* Fostered **community resilience and social cohesion** by empowering community organizations and volunteers to support vulnerable populations during heat emergencies.

# Relevant stakeholders

.pull-left[
* **Government**: Governments are primarily responsible for urban planning and management, such as urban planning department and environmental department. 
* **Academic institution**: Academic institutions are responsible for conducting research on the heat island effect, developing related technologies and methods.

* **Industry and enterprises**: Enterprises have a responsibility to reduce carbon emissions, because they generate a large amount of heat and greenhouse gas emissions in their operations

]

.pull-right[
* **Local community and citizens**: Residents are directly affected by the urban heat island effect. Therefore, they should provide more suggestions and feedback.

* **Environmental protection organization**: We should share our maps with environmental organizations to gather suggestions on facing climate change.

# Possible measures

**Hazard-Exposure-Vulnerability Risk Level**

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Low]

- **Public Education**
  - Causes and risks of urban heat islands
- **Early detection and warning systems**
  - Installation of temperature sensors and establishment of an early warning information platform
  - When a warning is triggered, this system can send out the warning message on time.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Medium]

- Public Education
- Early detection and warning systems
- **High temperature subsidies**
  - Vulnerable groups are more exposed to hot weather and the urban heat island effect partly because they cannot afford to pay high electricity bills.

- **Temporary Heat Shelters**
  - By providing *night shelters*, governments can help urban residents cope with the problems caused by hot weather and the urban heat island effect.

.panel[.panel-name[High]

- Public Education
- Early detection and warning systems
- High temperature subsidies
- Temporary Heat Shelters
- **Urban greening**
  -	Urban surface temperatures can be reduced and the heat island effect minimized by increasing vegetation cover and green space in cities.

- **Cool coating**
  -	Cooling coatings provide better thermal comfort for pedestrians.
