  abstract = {High-density cities are faced with growing extreme hot weather driven by climate change and local urbanization, but localized heat risk detection is still at an early stage for most cities (Watts et al., 2019). This study developed a spatiotemporal hazard-exposure-vulnerability assessment of the extreme heat risk in Hong Kong for 2006, 2011, and 2016 integrating cumulative very hot day hours and hot night hours in summer, population density and a principal component analysis (PCA) of demo-socioeconomic characteristics. The risk was found spatially variant, and high-risk spots were identified at the community scale for both daytime and nighttime with un­ derlying determinants behind. In both the daytime and the nighttime, high risk mainly occurred in the core urban areas. Nearly 10 more hot-spots were found in the nighttime than those in the daytime. Several old communities in Kowloon stayed at high risk from 2006 to 2016. Some new towns in the New Territories turned to be at higher risk in 2016 compared to 2006 and 2011, and this result showed signs to be emerging hot-spots in the near future. This study would be a useful reference for community-scale heat risk assessment and mitigation for the development of healthy and sustainable high-density cities.},

  abstract = {Extreme heat, also known as the silent killer that conceal its lethal effect behind heat-related deaths, has become one of the deadliest natural hazards globally. However, the evaluation of heat risks in many countries remains incomplete, overlooking an important component on population health conditions in the evaluation framework. Drawing on the IPCC’s risk assessment framework, this study presents, for the first time, a comprehensive heat health risk assessment in Australian capital cities, consisting of three individual indexes—the heat exposure index, heat hazard index and heat vulnerability index—at the finest census unit, and an overall heat health risk index (HHRI). By involving health-related indicators in heat risk assessment, our evaluation takes into account people’s sensitivity to heat in developing the heat health risk indexes. Using the HHRI, we identify high heat risk areas appearing primarily in higher density residential areas with some distances away from the inner cities. We also find that the inequity of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, housing features, and built envi­ ronment features exists in areas with different levels of heat risks. Our findings contribute not only to profiling heat risks in Australian cities, but also empirically advance our understanding of place-based risk reduction in the Southern Hemisphere by linking climate science with health and spatial science research.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that some disadvantaged socio-demographic groups face serious environmental-related inequities in Hong Kong due to the rising ambient urban temperatures. Identifying heat-vulnerable groups and locating areas of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) inequities is thus important for prioritizing interventions to mitigate death/illness rates from heat. This study addresses this problem by integrating methods of remote sensing retrieval, logistic regression modelling, and spatial autocorrelation. In this process, the SUHI effect was first estimated from the Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from a Landsat image. With the scale assimilated to the SUHI and socio-demographic data, a logistic regression model was consequently adopted to ascertain their relationships based on Hong Kong Tertiary Planning Units (TPUs). Lastly, inequity “hotspots” were derived using spatial autocorrelation methods. Results show that disadvantaged socio-demographic groups were significantly more prone to be exposed to an intense SUHI effect: over half of 287 TPUs characterized by age groups of 60+ years, secondary and matriculation education attainment, widowed, divorced and separated, low and middle incomes, and certain occupation groups of workers, have significant Odds Ratios (ORs) larger than 1.2. It can be concluded that a clustering analysis stratified by age, income, educational attainment, marital status, and occupation is an effective way to detect the inequity hotspots of SUHI exposure. Additionally, inequities explored using income, marital status and occupation factors were more significant than the age and educational attainment in these areas. The derived maps and model can be further analyzed in urban/city planning, in order to mitigate the physical and social causes of the SUHI effect.},

  abstract = {With frequent extreme heat events (EHEs), rapid urbanization, and uneven social development, comprehensive assessment of heat-related health risks is important for tolerating hot weather. This paper proposed a quanti­ tative method for assessing heat-related health risks at the grid scale. A combination of multisource remote sensing and socio-economic data was utilized to develop an integrated heat health risk index (HRI) considering three dimensions of heat hazards, exposure, and vulnerability in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. Compensating for the limitations of land surface temperature (LST) and station data, daily air temperatures were retrieved to calculate heat hazard index. Gridded population density data were developed using nighttime light data to calculate the exposure index. By combining them and other indicators, an HRI map of the YRD was developed. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity and dominant factors of the heat health risk were examined. The results showed that 13.2 \% of the areas in the YRD were in high and medium high risk, while 58.6 \% were in low and medium low risk. The high-risk areas were primarily concentrated in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Bay urban agglomeration, suggesting synergy between increased exposure and hazards in these metropolitan areas. The high-risk areas were predominantly dominated by hazard/exposure (H-E) and exposure/vulnerability (E-V), accounting for 27.2 \% and 21.9 \% of the YRD’s total area respectively. This study contributes to the identification of areas vulnerable to heat stress and provides references for optimizing heat risk management strategies.},

	abstract = {The Urban Heat Island ({UHI}) effect has been a cause of concern on human-induced impacts to urban climate. Construction materials absorb incoming solar radiation, causing additional sensible heat release to the urban environment resulting in urban air temperature changes. It has been proposed that covering the built-up surfaces such as building roofs and walls as well as road pavements, with cool surfaces which reflect most of the incoming solar radiation, could reduce heat absorption by construction materials and the subsequent heat release to urban environment. This paper, reports an experimental study of cool coating in a full-scale site setting located in Singapore during the summer months of tropical climate. The experimental site consists of four parallel industrial buildings forming two similar side-by-side street canyons. One of the canyons (‘Cool Canyon’) was cool coated on the roofs, walls and the road pavement whereas the other canyons remained as it was (‘Conventional Canyon’) as control. Air temperature, surface temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes in the two canyons were monitored for analysis of thermal exchanges between the build-up surfaces and the canyon micro-environment. The Cool Canyon had up to 30\% reduction in sensible heat release from the built-up surfaces which resulted in the air temperature in Cool Canyon being cooler than that in the Conventional Canyon by up to 2◦C around 16:00 h. An analysis of pedestrian thermal comfort in the two canyons was also conducted using Universal Thermal Climate Index ({UTCI}). When compared to the Conventional Canyon, the Cool Canyon provides improved thermal comfort to pedestrians with up to 1.5◦C reduction in {UTCI}. The paper also presents a critical analysis on thermal comfort due to the cool road in the middle of the street canyon.},

	abstract = {Abstract Surface temperature is often used to examine heat exposure in multi-city studies and for informing urban heat mitigation efforts due to scarcity of urban air temperature measurements. Cities also have lower relative humidity, traditionally not accounted for in large-scale observational urban heat risk assessments. Here, using crowdsourced measurements from over 40,000 weather stations in ≈600 urban clusters in Europe, we show the moderating effect of this urbanization-induced humidity reduction on outdoor heat stress during the 2019 heatwave. We demonstrate that daytime differences in heat index between urban clusters and their surroundings are weak, and associations of this urban-rural difference with background climate, generally examined from the surface temperature perspective, are diminished due to moisture feedbacks. We also examine the spatial variability of surface temperature, air temperature, and heat index within these clusters—relevant for detecting hotspots and potential disparities in heat exposure—and find that surface temperature is a poor proxy for the intra-urban distribution of heat index during daytime. Finally, urban vegetation shows much weaker (∼1/6th as strong) associations with heat index than with surface temperature, which has broad implications for optimizing urban heat stress mitigation strategies. These findings are valid for operational metrics of heat stress for shaded conditions (apparent temperature and humidex), thermodynamic proxies (wet-bulb temperature), and empirical heat indices. Based on this large-scale empirical evidence, surface temperature, used due to the lack of better alternatives, may not be suitable for accurately informing heat mitigation strategies within and across cities, necessitating more urban-scale observations and better urban-resolving models.},
